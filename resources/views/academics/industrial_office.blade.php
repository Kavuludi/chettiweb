                                        <br>
                                        The Industrial Liaison Office facilitates Personal Accident Insurance cover to all the students in the Institute. This is done 3 times in a year that is January, May and September as per the studentsâ€™ intake. They are provided to both new and continuing students annually depending on the intake. <br>
                                        
                                        <b>2. Industrial Attachment</b><br>                               
                                        
                                        Trainees will be going out for attachment in January to March, May to July or September to November annually depending on their requirements. All students taking courses in the Institute both Business and Technical, are required to go for Attachment during the course of their training.<br>
                                        
                                        All courses require students to be attached in the relevant Companies, Organizations or Firms for a period of 3 to 6 months depending on their programmes of study. The Office assists the trainees to get attachment places by providing them with Attachment Sourcing Letters.<br> 
                                        
                                        Once attached, the trainees inform the Institution where they are attached and arrangements are then made to visit and assess them. 
                                        Upon return to the Institution from Attachment, trainees are required to submit a copy of the recommendation letter, the Logbook and Industrial Attachment report to their respective departments.
